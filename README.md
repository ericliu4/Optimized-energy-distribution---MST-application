# GraphTheoryProject
Aim to capture application of graph theory, creating various projects directed towards real world problems 

Main prupose: find optimal routes for various of industries by exploring complex algorithms such as bellman ford, disjoint set union find (DSU), Krusal's algorithm
  Product 1: minimal routing for energy distribution
